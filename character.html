                    He's a former cybersecurity engineer of Allsafe Cybersecurity and a member of fsociety. He is played by Rami Malek. <br><br>
                    Elliot suffers from social anxiety disorder, clinical depression, delusions and paranoia.
                    His internal life is revealed via voice-overs that provide insight into his mental state,
                    his opinions of the people he encounters and the activity around him.
                    These dialogues with the audience are designed to help us interpret
                    Elliot's world, but given his mental illness, he is an unreliable narrator,
                    leaving us unsure whether what he tells us we're seeing is actually what is happening.
                    Typical of this is when Elliot hears everyone around him refer to E Corp as Evil Corp,
                    reflecting his own opinion of the conglomerate.

                    Mr. Robot is the co-founder and leader of the hacker group fsociety, a revolutionary prophet who plans to bring down the world's largest conglomerate.
                    Though he is intelligent and charismatic, Mr. Robot is also emotionally manipulative, and can be quick to turn violent.
                    It eventually becomes clear that Mr. Robot is a construct within Elliot Alderson's mind. (“eps1.8_m1rr0r1ng.qt”) His persona is an idealized representation of Elliot's deceased father, Edward;
                    where Edward was unwilling or unable to take action, Mr. Robot was created to inspire war against E Corp and incite historical change.
                    In some situations, Mr. Robot will take control and act through Elliot, thus explaining his direct interactions with other people. 
                    Mr. Robot is played by Christian Slater.
